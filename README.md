# ✈️: Airport Network & Route Planning Analysis

##  Objective
This project simulates how a real-world data scientist helps an airline make data-driven decisions. The goal is to identify high-demand routes, understand seasonal patterns, and reduce delays while handling unclean data.

##  Skills Covered
- Data Cleaning (handling missing, incorrect, and inconsistent data)
- Feature Engineering (delay ratios, route performance)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Time Series Forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet)
- Clustering (group airports based on traffic/performance)
- Classification (predict delay/cancellation likelihood)
- Business Insight Presentation

##  Dataset Overview
Synthetic flight records with messy data including:
- Origin/Destination airports
- Passenger counts
- Delay durations
- Route distances
- Aircraft types and months
- Cancelled flights (inconsistent formatting)

##  Business Questions
1. Which airports or routes are the busiest?
2. Where do most delays or cancellations occur?
3. What seasonal trends impact passenger volume?
4. Which new routes could be most profitable?
5. What airport clusters behave similarly?

##  Tools
- Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (ML)
- statsmodels / Prophet (Time Series)
- Jupyter Notebook for reporting
